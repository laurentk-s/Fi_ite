          <h2> About Me</h2>
          <p>My full name is Mbabazi Thierry Laurent Kirke-Smith and I am a 15 year old student currently in Riviera High School. I have had a passion for IT since I first touched a computer and thanks to Brit Hemming from Programmers 4 Peace and kLab I have been able to turn my dreams into a reality. I am honest, hardworking and I enjoy challenges. I work well independently and even better in a group. My <a href="#Skills" class="skls">skills</a> include web development and design. I can create wireframes and speak HTML and CSS. I can also work with a statistics site generator called Jekyll, JavaScript, and a JavaScript library known as JQuery. </p>
